# Movie App

This is a sample project to demonstrate the use of Spring Boot with the MongoDB database to create a full-stack web application. The application allows users to manage a list of movies, including the title, genre, and release date. Users can add, edit, and delete movies, as well as search for specific movies based on various criteria.
